# Adaptive RAG Project

## 📌 Overview
Adaptive RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a system that enhances LLM-based applications by dynamically adapting retrieval strategies to improve accuracy, relevance, and efficiency.  
This project aims to build a flexible RAG pipeline that can adjust retrieval depth, sources, and response generation strategies based on user queries and context.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 Adaptive retrieval mechanism (query expansion, re-ranking, hybrid search)
- 🤖 Integration with LLMs for response generation
- ⚡ Configurable pipeline components for experimentation
- 📂 Modular design to plug in new retrievers and knowledge sources
- 📊 Evaluation utilities for quality and performance metrics
